 - get name string, we'll be using the first letter as the main graphical feature
 - figure out font and colour based on other content in the string - maybe with some kind of random function using the content as a seed? maybeeeeee something else?
 - provisioning for sizing? what's the smallest resolution we can get this work at?
 - test by generating a ton of different images, look for confusing levels of similarity, like 'visual collisions' basically
